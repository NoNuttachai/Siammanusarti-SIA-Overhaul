    "text": "The Balance of Power mechanic for Siam had several issues preventing it from working correctly. Here is a summary of the fixes applied:\n\n1.  **History File Error**:\n    *   **Problem**: In `history/countries/SIA - Siam.txt`, the `set_power_balance` effect was using incorrect syntax (`left_side` and `right_side` parameters, which belong in the definition file, not the history file).\n    *   **Fix**: Changed it to `set_power_balance = { id = SIA_Rep_House_BOP value = 0.0 }` to correctly initialize the mechanic.\n\n2.  **Decision Logic & Tooltips**:\n    *   **Problem**: The decision `SIA_entice_the_people` in `common/decisions/nutt_SIA.txt` referred to a non-existent side ID (`SIA_RH_OPPOSITION`) and used invalid AI triggers (`has_variable` instead of `power_balance_value`).\n    *   **Fix**:\n        *   Updated `tooltip_side` to `SIA_RH_KHANA` (Khana Ratsadon), as the value `+0.10` moves the balance towards the Right (Khana Ratsadon).\n        *   Replaced invalid `has_variable` checks in `ai_will_do` with proper `power_balance_value` triggers.\n\n3.  **National Focus Integration**:\n    *   **Problem**: The focus `SIA_legacy_of_revolution` in `common/national_focus/SIA.txt` attempted to shift the balance of power by changing a variable (`SIA_balance_of_power`) instead of using the actual BOP effect.\n    *   **Fix**: Replaced the variable change with `add_power_balance_value = { id = SIA_Rep_House_BOP value = 0.05 tooltip_side = SIA_RH_KHANA }`.\n\nThe mechanic should now initialize correctly, and decisions/focuses should properly affect the Balance of Power.",

    "text": "The Balance of Power decision `SIA_entice_the_people` has been updated to `SIA_entice_the_masses` as requested. \n\nI have modified the decision to work similarly to the Finnish \"Entice the People\" decision (from Arms Against Tyranny) by applying a weekly drift to the Balance of Power and Stability over the duration of the decision, rather than an instant effect. I retained the instant manpower gain as a completion reward.\n\n### Changes Made:\n1.  **Updated Decision ID**: Renamed `SIA_entice_the_people` to `SIA_entice_the_masses` in `common/decisions/nutt_SIA.txt`.\n2.  **Adjusted Mechanics**:\n    *   Removed `add_power_balance_value` (instant change) from `complete_effect`.\n    *   Added a `modifier` block with `power_balance_weekly = 0.005` (drift towards Khana Ratsadon) and `stability_weekly = -0.001`.\n    *   Kept `days_remove = 120` to define the duration of these drifts.\n3.  **Updated Localization**: Changed the localization key in `localisation/english/mod_focuses_localisations_l_english.yml` to `SIA_entice_the_masses` and updated the display name to **\"Entice the Masses\"**.\n\nThe decision now unlocks properly via the `SIA_legacy_of_revolution` focus (using the existing flag) and applies its effects over time.",
