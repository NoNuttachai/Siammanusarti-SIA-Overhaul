    "text": "I have rearranged and corrected the **Army** and **Navy** branches in `common/national_focus/SIA.txt`.\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1.  **Army Branch:**\n    *   **Centered Layout:** The branch now flows symmetrically from `SIA_army` (x=18).\n    *   **Sub-branches:**\n        *   **Left (Reserves):** `SIA_increase_the_reserve_force`, `SIA_yuwachon_thahan`, `SIA_yuwanaree`.\n        *   **Center (Doctrine):** `SIA_prussian_school_of_warfare` (Mutually Exclusive with Guerilla) and `SIA_adopt_guerilla_tactics`.\n        *   **Right (Procurement & Intel):** `SIA_special_branch_bureau`, `SIA_purchase_new_arms`, `SIA_army_science_department`.\n    *   **Logic Fixes:**\n        *   `SIA_improve_army_logistics` now correctly accepts *either* Prussian or Guerilla tactics (OR logic via single prerequisite block).\n        *   `SIA_develop_mobile_warfare` is properly linked to `SIA_import_foreign_tanks`.\n        *   `SIA_bicycle_infantry` connects `SIA_yuwachon_thahan` and `SIA_develop_mobile_warfare`.\n\n2.  **Navy Branch:**\n    *   **Cleaned Layout:** The branch starts at `SIA_navy` (x=8) and expands without overlapping the Army branch.\n    *   **Sub-branches:**\n        *   **Left (Operations):** `SIA_thai_gulf_minelaying_operation`, `SIA_marines` -> `SIA_amphibia`.\n        *   **Center (Bases):** `SIA_expand_sattahip_naval_base` -> `SIA_expand_naval_repair_facilities` -> `SIA_naval_academy`.\n        *   **Right (Industry & Ships):** `SIA_acquire_bangkok_dock_co` and `SIA_commission_foreign_ships`.\n    *   **Corrections:**\n        *   Removed the duplicate `SIA_acquire_bangkok_dock_co` entry.\n        *   Clarified relative positioning for ship acquisition focuses to ensure they appear in a readable tree structure.\n\n3.  **General:**\n    *   Ensured all `relative_position_id`s refer to existing focuses.\n    *   Verified coordinates to prevent overlap with the Political or Economy branches.",
