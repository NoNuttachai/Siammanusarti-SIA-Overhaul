    SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The only country in Southeast Asia to escape European colonialism, Siam stood at an uncertain crossroads. Absolute monarchy came to an end after a bloodless revolution in 1932, led by major members of the armed forces and the civilian sector, collectively known as the 'Khana Ratsadon.' \nThey succefully have King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) install a constitutional system. A pro-monarchist rebellion led by Prince Boworadej soon follow which was swiftly crushed. \n\nWith many within the Siamese government vying for power and the world preparing for war, it is clear that Siam cannot remain idle on the world stage for long."

As a result, we failed to respond before Japan’s strict deadline of just two hours. Japanese forces, by land and sea, have begun their invasion of the country.\n\nOur soldiers, policemen, and Yuwachon Thahan (Junior Soldiers) resisted the might of the Japanese army with bravery, managing to stall their advance. Many perished in defense of our homeland.\n\nAfter several hours of fierce fighting, our government and Japan reached a ceasefire agreement, granting Japan access to our territory.
